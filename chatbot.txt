What is Hypertension
Blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood against the walls of the body’s arteries, the major blood vessels in the body, Hypertension is when blood pressure is too high since blood pressure is written as two numbers, the first (systolic) number represents the pressure in blood vessels when the heart contracts or beats and the second (diastolic) number represents the pressure in the vessels when the heart rests between beats so, hypertension is diagnosed if, when it is measured on two different days, the systolic blood pressure readings on both days is ≥140 mmHg and/or the diastolic blood pressure readings on both days is ≥90 mmHg.

Risk factors for hypertension
Modifiable risk factors include unhealthy diets (excessive salt consumption, a diet high in saturated fat and trans fats, low intake of fruits and vegetables), physical inactivity, consumption of tobacco and alcohol, and being overweight or obese.Non-modifiable risk factors include a family history of hypertension, age over 65 years and co-existing diseases such as diabetes or kidney disease.

Common symptoms 
Most people with hypertension are unaware of the problem because it may have no warning signs or symptoms, hence it is essential that blood pressure is measured regularly, also, when symptoms do occur, they can include early morning headaches, nosebleeds, irregular heart rhythms, vision changes, and buzzing in the ears. Severe hypertension can cause fatigue, nausea, vomiting, confusion, anxiety, chest pain, and muscle tremors.
 
Complications 
Among other complications, hypertension can cause serious damage to the heart, in addition, hypertension can cause kidney damage, leading to kidney failure.

Prevention 
Reducing salt intake (to less than 5g daily), eating more fruit and vegetables, being physically active on a regular basis, avoiding use of tobacco, reducing alcohol consumption, limiting the intake of foods high in saturated fats, eliminating/reducing trans fats in diet.

Management 
Reducing and managing stress, regularly checking blood pressure, treating high blood pressure, managing other medical conditions.

Brief information on Typhoid
Typhoid fever is a life-threatening infection caused by the bacterium SalmonellaTyphi and it is usually spread through contaminated food or water, once SalmonellaTyphi bacteria are eaten or drunk, they multiply and spread into the bloodstream.

Symptoms 
Symptoms include prolonged high fever, fatigue, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation or diarrhoea, while some patients may have a rash and severe cases may lead to serious complications or even death. 

Treatment 
It is important for people being treated for typhoid fever to do the following take prescribed antibiotics for as long as the doctor has prescribed, wash their hands with soap and water after using the bathroom, and do not prepare or serve food for other people as this will lower the chance of passing the infection on to someone else, have their doctor test to ensure that no Salmonella Typhi bacteria remain in their body.

Prevention 
Access to safe water and adequate sanitation, hygiene among food handlers and typhoid vaccination are all effective in preventing typhoid fever, also two vaccines have been used for many years to protect people from typhoid fever, also, ensure food is properly cooked and still hot when served, avoid raw milk and products made from raw milk, drink only pasteurized or boiled milk, avoid ice unless it is made from safe water, when the safety of drinking water is questionable, boil it or if this is not possible, disinfect it with a reliable, slow-release disinfectant agent (usually available at pharmacies), wash hands thoroughly and frequently using soap, in particular after contact with pets or farm animals, or after having been to the toilet, wash fruits and vegetables carefully, particularly if they are eaten raw and if possible, vegetables and fruits should be peeled.

HIV/AIDS
The human immunodeficiency virus targets the immune system and weakens people's defense against many infections and some types of cancer that people with healthy immune systems can fight off, as the virus destroys and impairs the function of immune cells, infected individuals gradually become immunodeficient, immune function is typically measured by CD4 cell count and its most advanced stage is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, which can take many years to develop if not treated, depending on the individual. 
Signs and symptoms
The symptoms  vary depending on the stage of infection, though people living with HIV tend to be most infectious in the first few months after being infected, many are unaware of their status until the later stages and in the first few weeks after initial infection people may experience no symptoms or an influenza-like illness including fever, headache, rash or sore throat, as the infection progressively weakens the immune system, they can develop other signs and symptoms, such as swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, fever, diarrhoea and cough. Without treatment, they could also develop severe illnesses such as tuberculosis (TB), cryptococcal meningitis, severe bacterial infections, and cancers such as lymphomas and Kaposi's sarcoma.
Transmission
HIV can be transmitted via the exchange of a variety of body fluids from infected people, such as blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal secretions and it can also be transmitted from a mother to her child during pregnancy and delivery, however individuals cannot become infected through ordinary day-to-day contact such as kissing, hugging, shaking hands, or sharing personal objects, food or water and it is important to note that people with HIV who are taking ART and are virally suppressed do not transmit HIV to their sexual partners. 
Risk factors
Having unprotected anal or vaginal sex, having another sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as syphilis, herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhoea and bacterial vaginosis, sharing contaminated needles, syringes and other injecting equipment and drug solutions when injecting drugs, receiving unsafe injections, blood transfusions and tissue transplantation, and medical procedures that involve unsterile cutting or piercing, and experiencing accidental needle stick injuries, including among health workers
Diagnosis
HIV can be diagnosed through rapid diagnostic tests that provide same-day results as this greatly facilitates early diagnosis and linkage with treatment and care, people can also use HIV self-tests to test themselves, however, no single test can provide a full HIV diagnosis; confirmatory testing is required, conducted by a qualified and  trained health or community worker at a community centre or clinic, and infection can be detected with great accuracy using WHO prequalified tests within a nationally approved testing strategy and while testing for adolescents and adults has been made simple and efficient, this is not the case for babies born to HIV-positive mothers as for children less than 18 months of age, serological testing is not sufficient to identify the infection – virological testing must be provided as early as birth or at 6 weeks of age. 
Prevention
 Key approaches for prevention, which are often used in combination, include male and female condom use, testing and counselling for HIV and STIs, testing and counselling for linkages to tuberculosis (TB) care, voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), use of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) for prevention, harm reduction for people who inject and use drugs and elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.
Treatment
HIV disease can be managed by treatment regimens composed of a combination of three or more antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, current antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not cure HIV infection but highly suppresses viral replication within a person's body and allows an individual's immune system recovery to strengthen and regain the capacity to fight off opportunistic infections and some cancers.

Sepsis
Background
Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection and if not recognized early and managed promptly, it can lead to septic shock, multiple organ failure and death, it is most frequently a serious complication of infection, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where it represents a major cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.
Prevention
Implementing preventive measures against infections, such as good hygiene practices, ensuring access to vaccination programmes, improved sanitation and water quality and availability, and other infection prevention and control best practices both in the community and health care settings, are key steps in reducing the occurrence of sepsis, also early diagnosis and timely and appropriate clinical management of sepsis, such as optimal antimicrobial use and fluid resuscitation, are crucial to increase the likelihood of survival. 
Who is at risk?
Anyone affected by an infection, severe injury, or serious non-communicable disease can progress to sepsis but vulnerable populations are at higher risk including, older persons, pregnant or recently pregnant women, neonates, hospitalized patients, patients in intensive care units, people with HIV/AIDS, people with liver cirrhosis, people with cancer, people with kidney disease, people with autoimmune diseases, and people with no spleen.
Signs and symptoms
Fever or low temperature and shivering, altered mental status, difficulty breathing/rapid breathing, increased heart rate, weak pulse/low blood pressure, low urine output, cyanotic or mottled skin, cold extremities, and extreme body pain or discomfort (5-7).
Diagnosis and Clinical Management
Identifying and not underestimating the signs and symptoms, along with the detection of some biomarkers (such as C reactive protein and procalcitonin), are crucial elements for early diagnosis of sepsis and the timely establishment of its appropriate clinical management, after early recognition, diagnostics to help identify a causal pathogen of infection leading to sepsis are important to guide targeted antimicrobial treatment, repeated exams and assessments, including monitoring vital signs, guide the appropriate management of sepsis over time.

Diabetes
Overview
Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces, wherein insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar, hyperglycaemia, or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.

Type 2
Type 2 diabetes (formerly called non-insulin-dependent, or adult-onset) results from the body’s ineffective use of insulin. The majority of people have this type and this type of diabetes is largely the result of excess body weight and physical inactivity.

Type 1 
Type 1 diabetes (previously known as insulin-dependent, juvenile or childhood-onset) is characterized by deficient insulin production and requires daily administration of insulin, neither the cause of Type 1 diabetes nor the means to prevent it are known and symptoms include excessive excretion of urine (polyuria), thirst (polydipsia), constant hunger, weight loss, vision changes, and fatigue which may occur suddenly.
Gestational 
Gestational diabetes is hyperglycaemia with blood glucose values above normal but below those diagnostic of diabetes It occurs during pregnancy and
women with it are at an increased risk of complications during pregnancy and at delivery, these women and possibly their children are also at increased risk of its type 2  in the future, it is diagnosed through prenatal screening, rather than through reported symptoms.
Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemia
Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) are intermediate conditions in the transition between normality and diabetes, people with IGT or IFG are at high risk of progressing to type 2, although this is not inevitable.

Health Impact-
Over time,it can damage the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves, adults with diabetes have a two- to three-fold increased risk of heart attacks and strokes, combined with reduced blood flow, neuropathy (nerve damage) in the feet increases the chance of foot ulcers, infection and eventual need for limb amputation, Diabetic retinopathy is an important cause of blindness, and occurs as a result of long-term accumulated damage to the small blood vessels in the retina. 
Prevention (Simple tips) :-
Simple lifestyle measures have been shown to be effective in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes, so to help prevent type 2 diabetes and its complications, people should achieve and maintain a healthy body weight; be physically active – doing at least 30 minutes of regular, moderate-intensity activity on most days, More activity is required for weight control; eat a healthy diet, avoiding sugar and saturated fats; and avoid tobacco use – smoking increases the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Diagnosis and treatment
Early diagnosis can be accomplished through relatively inexpensive testing of blood sugar, treatment of diabetes involves diet and physical activity along with lowering of blood glucose and the levels of other known risk factors that damage blood vessels, tobacco use cessation is also important to avoid complications also, interventions that are both cost-saving and feasible in low- and middle-income countries include blood glucose control, particularly in type 1 diabetes, blood pressure control; and foot care (patient self-care by maintaining foot hygiene; wearing appropriate footwear; seeking professional care for ulcer management; and regular examination of feet by health professionals), other cost saving interventions include screening and treatment for retinopathy (which causes blindness); blood lipid control (to regulate cholesterol levels); screening for early signs of diabetes-related kidney disease and treatment.
